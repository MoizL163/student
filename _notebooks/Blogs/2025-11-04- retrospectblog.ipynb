    "\n",
    "### 1. Key things from the 3 sprints\n",
    "**Tools:** I learned how to actually use GitHub and Jupyter notebooks without breaking everything. It was a very good introduction into the class.\n",
    "**Fundamentals:** I got more comfortable with loops, conditionals, and lists, basically the building blocks of all code. Also, I liked how I learned it in both languages.\n",
    "**West Coast Travel:** I learned how to connect coding with real stuff, like tracking stadium data using APIs. Seattle’s stadiums made it feel like a real project, not just random code.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. How N@tM went\n",
    "N@tM was pretty fun, people liked the idea of mixing sports and coding.  \n",
    "One person said it was “cool that you could actually map the stadiums like a real trip,” which I’ll take as a win.  \n",
    "Another said, “You should add live data from an API,” which might actually be my next step.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. What I want to do next on the project\n",
    "Make the Seattle section more interactive, maybe add buttons or filters to pick a sport or stadium type.  \n",
    "If we have time, I want to show distances between stadiums or maybe ticket prices.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. What I want to learn next in CompSci\n",
    "I want to learn how APIs really work, like how to pull real-time data into a project.  \n",
    "Also, maybe get better at frontend stuff so my project looks cleaner and not like “developer art.”\n"
