    "### Compare Yourself to the Beginning of the Year\n",
    "At the start of the year, I came into the class with the midnset of playing chess and goofing off. I didn’t really connect that mindset to coding. But now, I see how similar they are. Coding is all about logic and predicting outcomes. I went from playing chess on a board to “playing” it in a code editor.\n",

    "### Remember Key Things from 3 Sprints\n",
    "**Tools Sprint:** I learned how to use GitHub, Replit, and Jupyter notebooks, which felt confusing at first, but now it’s second nature. I understand how to push commits, write clean markdown, and organize my code. Its so weird how I found something so frustrating when I can do it in 30 seconds now.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Fundamentals of JavaScript/Python:** I came into this class wanting to learn code and I was actually pretty excited when we got to the actual lessons. Learning about different functions in Python and JS was what I took the class for and I finally got that. Presenting a lesson my group made and had knowledge on was also pretty cool.\n",
    "\n",
    "**West Coast Travel Sprint:** This one was my favorite. My group focused on a road trip from San Diego to Seattle, visiting stadiums along the way. I worked on the Seattle section — researching sports culture there and finding ways to connect code to real-world data. It felt like an actual project, not just a classroom task.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### How N@tM Went\n",
    "Night at the Museum went way better than I expected. A bunch of people were actually interested in our “Stadium Quest” idea, traveling up the coast and coding it out. Some liked the visuals and said it felt like a real travel app. I was very surprised that so many people were in the room and it looked crowded, not something I am used to. One person mentioned they’d love to see live game data or team stats for each stadium, which gave me ideas for adding an API later. It was cool hearing real feedback instead of just a grade, like seeing people interact with something I helped build.\n",

    "### MCQ Review, Score, and Approach\n",
    "I got a **39/66** on the multiple-choice test. I left 8 questions blank — not because I ran out of time, but because I didn’t want to just guess. For every question I did answer, I made sure to read carefully and reason through the options. If I was completely lost, I skipped it. My approach was more about understanding than guessing. Now I know I need to focus more on recognizing how questions connect to the big ideas, not just the code.\n",
    "### MCQ Strengths & Weaknesses\n",
    "\n",
    "**Strengths:**  \n",
    "I did well on questions that involved **ethical reasoning** and **logical thinking**. Those questions made sense to me because they focused on reasoning through a situation instead of memorizing syntax.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Weaknesses:**  \n",
    "I struggled more with **finishing lines of code** or syntax-heavy problems. I often knew what the code was supposed to do but missed small details when completing it. I plan to practice short coding drills to improve accuracy and confidence with syntax.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Examples**\n",
    "## Q11 — Spinner Simulation\n",
    "\n",
    "- **My answer:** **B**  \n",
    "- **Correct answer:** **D**\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why my answer was wrong\n",
    "I chose option B because I thought using `RANDOM(1, 3)` would simulate the three sections correctly. But that actually makes each color — Red, Blue, and Yellow — equally likely, each with a 1/3 chance. The problem said Red’s section was four times as large as the others, so my code didn’t reflect that difference in probability.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why the correct answer is right\n",
    "Option D uses `RANDOM(1, 6)` and assigns:\n",
    "- 1 → Yellow  \n",
    "- 2 → Blue  \n",
    "- Everything else (3–6) → Red  \n",
    "\n",
    "This setup gives Red a 4/6 chance and Blue/Yellow each a 1/6 chance. That matches the description perfectly since Red is supposed to be four times as likely as either of the other colors.\n",
    "\n",
    " ## Q14 — Comparing Loop Algorithms\n",
    "\n",
    "- **My answer:** **B**  \n",
    "- **Correct answer:** **C**\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why my answer was wrong\n",
    "I chose option B because I thought both programs displayed the same numbers but just in a different order. I didn’t look closely enough at *when* each program updates the variable `i` versus when it displays it. I assumed moving the `DISPLAY` and `i ← i + 1` lines wouldn’t change which values appear, but it actually changes the numbers themselves.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why the correct answer is right\n",
    "In **Program A**, the display happens *before* increasing `i`.  \n",
    "- It starts at `i = 1`, displays 1, then adds 1 each loop → displays **1 through 10**.  \n",
    "\n",
    "In **Program B**, the increase happens *before* the display.  \n",
    "- It starts at `i = 1`, immediately adds 1 to make `i = 2`, then displays → displays **2 through 11**.  \n",
    "\n",
    "So both programs display the **same number of values** (10 total), but the **values differ** — Program A shows 1–10 while Program B shows 2–11.\n",
